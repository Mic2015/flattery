Sketchup Plugin for Unfolding or Flattening Models - Works in Sketchup 2016

Original source and author of this plugin is at http://www.pumpkinpirate.info/flattery/. But the version up there does not work with latest version of sketchup.
I could not contact the original author regarding the fixes or updates to this plugin, so I went ahead made the fixes myself and put it here for anyone still interested.

I have tested this on a Windows machine with Sketchup 2016 and it appears to be working fine. I make no gurantee/warantee on its correctness, use at your own risk.

**Installation**
To install Flattery, copy the file "flattery.rb" and the folder "flattery" into the SketchUp plugins folder. On Windows, this folder is at 

C:\Users\\***your user name***\\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2016\SketchUp\Plugins

Restart Sketchup and enable the Flattery by going to "Window -> Preference -> Extensions" and check the flattery plugin. You should see the flattery toolbar on the sketup now.
